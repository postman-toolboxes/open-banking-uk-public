                      Market segmentation is a marketing term
                      referring to the aggregating of
                      prospective buyers into groups, or
                      segments, that have common needs and
                      respond similarly to a marketing action.
                      Market segmentation enables companies to
                      target different categories of consumers
                      who perceive the full value of certain
                      products and services differently from
                      one another.
